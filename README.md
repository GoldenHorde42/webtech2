# Device repair website using HTML, JS, PHP and phpMyAdmin. I used HTML,CSS and JS for the frontend and PHP for communicating with the database. Users can post queries regarding their website and other users can answer the questions. I used to regular expressions to filter out questions that have been already asked. Users can view already asked questions in a neat table format. The CSS is quite simplistic on this and further work will be done on it.
